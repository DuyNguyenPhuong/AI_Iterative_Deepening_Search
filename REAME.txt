2 versions --> explain the bottom level

This my experience when testing the last iteration of iterative deepening search
and the full iterative deepening search

The result is:

For solution has the length of 4, Time taken to run the last iteration 0.0013129711151123047
For solution has the length of 4, Time taken to run full 0.0029802322387695312
For solution has the length of 8, Time taken to run the last iteration 0.049353837966918945
For solution has the length of 8, Time taken to run full 0.10139989852905273
For solution has the length of 10, Time taken to run the last iteration 1.1008450984954834
For solution has the length of 10, Time taken to run full 1.9244379997253418
For solution has the length of 12, Time taken to run the last iteration 1.4210882186889648
For solution has the length of 12, Time taken to run full 8.012397050857544

For both of the solution, in the last iteration, we will break if we reach the solution, so that
most of the time, we never complete the bottom level

Look at the first 3 results, we see that the time difference is not much difference. Because, we can see that
because in a tree bottom level contain most of the node. So that the iteration of the level above the bottom
level will be insignificant.
